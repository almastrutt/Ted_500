                        <h6>A stock market, equity market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers 
                        of stocks
                        (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a 
                        public stock exchange as well as those only traded privately. Examples of the latter include shares of 
                        private companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. 
                        Stock exchanges list shares of common equity as well as other security types, e.g. corporate bonds and convertible bonds.</h6>

                        <p><img src="/images/stockexchange_news.jpg" alt="image of stock exchange" style="width:100%" border="2" />The New York Stock Exchange has been the gateway to generations of epic adventures and breakthroughs, helping companies raise the capital that raises the world. When you follow your true calling, greatness is born. Our true calling is to help great companies do great things. <br>The NYSE is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, an American holding company that it also lists. Previously, it was part of NYSE Euronext (NYX), which was formed by the NYSE's 2007 merger with Euronext.

The NYSE has been the subject of several lawsuits regarding fraud or breach of duty[10][11] and in 2004 was sued by its former CEO for breach of contract and defamation.</p>
